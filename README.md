# ATracker data analysis

To use this, export your data from ATracker by emailing it to yourself, and place the `CSVFile.csv` file in this directory. Also, export data from Pedometer++ (or any app that exports a CSV with a `Date` and `Steps` column) and place the `Pedometer.csv` file in this directory.

Run `streamlit run analysis.py` to open the dashboard.
