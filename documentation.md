## Categorization rules

- The categories are the ones in the graph above.
- If multiple activities are being performed simultaneously (e.g., watching YouTube while eating), the _primary_ activity is registered. In the previous example, it would be coded as "Streaming", NOT "Food"). A general rule (that is not perfectly accurate) is the following two questions: (a) when describing what you're doing to a friend, what do you mention first? (b) which activity takes more of the time?
- Some activities are grouped: _any_ activity in the washroom are grouped into "Washroom"; _all_ forms of social media are grouped into "Social media"; _any_ streaming service being used categorizes as "Streaming".
- If you're wondering, working on this is categorized as "Programming".

### Categorization examples, exceptions, and idiosyncracies

- Using social media while in the washroom is categorized as "Washroom", the rationale being that you must physically move to the washroom to perform both tasks simultaneously (at least, _typically_).
- Traveling to/from work is categorized as "Roaming".
- Drinking coffee while working is categorized as "Work", not "Coffee".
- Drinking coffee while talking to a friend is categorized as "Coffee". However, doing the same outside (such as in a cafe) is categorized as "Roaming", due to the need to go outside to a specific location. For this reason, _any_ social visit outside the house is considered "Roaming".
- Because of the above rule, friends coming over is categorized as "Misc".
- Listening to music while doing nothing else is categorized as "Misc". However, doing anything while listening to music (such as working) is categorized as that activity. 
- Doing dishes is _typically_ categorized as "Misc"; however, a lot of dishwashing actually happens as a result of noticing the dishes while roaming around the house--in these specific cases, it is categorized as "Roaming".
